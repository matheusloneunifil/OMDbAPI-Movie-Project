# OMDBAPI Movie Project

Developed by Matheus Lone Arruda  

This is an SPA(Single Page Application) that fetches information on a piece of media, searched by name(expanded from just movies, so we can show TV shows, for example), from the mentioned API and shows it to the user, with  relevant information displayed, such as actors, writers, director, available languages and the review scores. 

-Use the search bar to type the name of your movie, show, and even some albums, and click the "search" button to execute the task.
-Thr "reset" button will clear the information and allow for a new search
-The "favourite" button simulates the user being able to favorite movies.
